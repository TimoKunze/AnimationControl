- FIX: The control could crash the other process during OLE drag'n'drop, especially when IOLEDataObject::SetDropDescription() had been called.



Version 2.7.0 - 19/01/2016

- Added the IAnimation::FinishOLEDragDrop method. It should not be used if not really needed. It can be used to hide the drag image if execution of the OLEDragDrop event takes a long time or if a message is displayed from within this event.

Version 2.6.1 - 29/05/2014

Version 2.5.2 - 28/03/2013

- FIX: The ResizedControlWindow event was not fired when it should have been fired.



Version 2.5.1 - 02/09/2012

- FIX: Clicking the control no longer raises the Validate event of the currently focused control.
- Initial support for Windows 8.



Version 2.5.0 - 11/03/2012

- Rewrote the drawing code again, because the previous version still had drawing issues.
- Reimplemented the subclassing code of the VB6 samples to make it more robust.



Version 2.4.0 - 11/01/2012

- Rewrote the drawing code for the case that the client application uses version 6.x of comctl32.dll. This should fix drawing issues.
- Fixed the VB6 samples.



Version 2.3.1 - 20/05/2011

- Fixed a bug that could make other, invisible windows visible again under rather complex circumstances. I'm not sure this could happen practically, but in theory it could happen and practically it did happen for the Frame control which had the same bug.
- FIX: The ResizedControlWindow event was fired when actually nothing had changed.

Version 2.2.1 - 01/01/2010

- Improved support for Aero drag images.
- Improved performance.
- FIX: The 'shift' parameter that many events have, often missed the ALT key.

Version 2.2.0 - 25/07/2009

- Initial support for Windows 7.
- Extended the DropDescriptionIconConstants enumeration by 'ddiUseDefault'.
- FIX: Drop descriptions didn't work as expected if the drag source was a 64 bit app.

- FIX: Ignore calls to IOLEDataObject::SetDropDescription() if the drag image is in classic style.
- Fixed some GDI handle leaks.

- Slightly changed handling of the situation where the user presses a mouse button, drags the mouse out of the control's client area and releases the button.
- Removed the data-binding stuff (it was probably broken anyway).
- Switched to Visual C++ 2008 and dropped support for Windows 9x, Me and NT 4.0.
- Improved the documentation.
